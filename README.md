# Rare Medicinal Plants Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing rare and endangered medicinal plant species using Power BI. The goal is to visualize key trends, understand species distribution, and assess their conservation status. This interactive dashboard helps researchers, conservationists, and policymakers make data-driven decisions to protect these plants.
 ## Dataset Used
-<a href="https://github.com/aradhyatrehan20/Rare_Medicinal_Plants/blob/main/Rare%20plants(2000)B.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions(KPIs)
- How many rare medicinal plant species are recorded in the dataset?
- Which plant families have the highest number of rare or endangered species?
- What is the trend of rare plant discoveries over different years?
- Which conservation status (e.g., S3, S4, S5) is most common among the species?
- Which regions or locations have the highest number of rare medicinal plants?
- How does the conservation status vary across different plant families?
- Which years saw a decline or increase in rare plant counts?
- What percentage of the plants are classified as endangered or vulnerable?
- How does the origin (native vs. non-native) impact the conservation status of plants?
- Can we identify any patterns in plant families that are more at risk of endangerment?
## Process
- Data Cleaning & Preparation – Check for missing values, remove duplicates, standardize formats, and transform data using Power Query.
- Data Modeling & Relationships – Identify key columns, establish relationships, and create calculated columns or measures using DAX.
- Visualization & Dashboard Creation – Use bar charts, pie charts, treemaps, and line graphs to analyze trends, species distribution, and conservation status.
- Dashboard Optimization & Formatting – Apply consistent colors, tooltips, data labels, and interactive slicers to improve readability and usability.
- Insights & Analysis – Identify trends in endangered species, high-risk families, and changes in conservation status to support biodiversity research.
- Export & Sharing – Publish the Power BI report, generate PDF insights, and upload project files (dataset, PBIX, README) to GitHub for documentation.

## Project Insight
- Cyperaceae, Orchidaceae, and Onagraceae are among the most frequently recorded plant families in the dataset.
- Over 90% of the recorded plants are native species, highlighting their ecological significance.
- S3-ranked plants (Vulnerable or At-Risk) dominate the dataset, indicating conservation concerns.
- The highest number of recorded plant species occurred between 2012 and 2014, showing a trend in rare plant observations.
- Most endangered plants are found in limited geographical areas, requiring focused conservation efforts.
- Interactive analysis through Power BI slicers allows users to filter data by family, conservation status, and year for better insights.
## Conclusion
To enhance the conservation efforts for rare medicinal plants, priority should be given to species categorized as S3 (Vulnerable or At-Risk), as they make up the majority of endangered plants. The analysis indicates that certain plant families, such as Cyperaceae and Orchidaceae, are more frequently at risk, requiring focused protection measures. Additionally, most recorded species are native, emphasizing the need for habitat preservation and sustainable conservation strategies.
